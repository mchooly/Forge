' Forge - GUI launcher (no console window).
'
' Why not just double-click the .bat: a .bat is executed by cmd.exe, which is
' a console program, so Windows always allocates a black console window for it.
' The dependency check below (import yaml, tkinter) takes a few hundred ms, so
' that black box stays on screen long enough to see before it disappears. A
' .bat has no way to hide its own console - this was reported as "a black box
' flashes when opening the GUI".
'
' wscript.exe is a GUI-subsystem host: it never allocates a console, and every
' child process started below uses window style 0 (hidden). So nothing dark
' appears between the double-click and the Tk window showing up.
'
' Why not a .pyw: on machines where Python came from the Python Install
' Manager, .pyw has no file association at all, and double-clicking one does
' nothing whatsoever - a silent failure, which is worse than a flash.
'
' ASCII-only, same rule as the .bat launchers (see forge.bat).
